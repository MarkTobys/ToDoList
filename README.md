This is a simple C# based console application I'm creating while learning C#.
Its sole purpose is a way for me to familiarize myself with using different data types and features of C#.
Once I'm done with it you should be able to add, edit and delete tasks as well as their descriptions and due dates, then save them locally to your computer.
Due to limitations with the console and the small scope of this project there is no option to "directly" edit task names and due dates.
There is also no error handling for reading in the ToDoList.txt save file so any alterations made outside of the program may lead to crashes when trying to read in data.

potential future updates:
- a "scrolling" task menu so users can store than a few dozen tasks at once
- date sensitive "alert" text on the task list screen showing users the due date of their task, which changes colour depending on its due date i.e. green: not due soon, orange: due very soon, red: overdue
- comprehensive overhaul of saving and reading data to a more robust format and in depth error checking to avoid crashes
