This is a simple C# based console application I'm creating while learning C#.
Its sole purpose is a way for me to familiarize myself with using different data types and features of C#.
Once I'm done with it you should be able to add, edit and delete tasks as well as their descriptions and due dates, then save them locally to your computer.
