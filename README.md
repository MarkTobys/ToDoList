This is a simple C# based console application I'm creating while learning C#
It's sole purpose is a way for me to familiarize myself with using different data types and features of C# 
Once I'm done with it you should be able to add, edit and delete tasks to the list with due descriptions and due dates and then save them locally to your computer
